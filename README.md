## Rock, Paper, Scissors
This is currently a basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in Javascript and played via user prompts.

With each page load, a five-round game is initiated and the final score is displayed in the console.

From other reading, I understand that this project will be expanded upon as I progress further in The Odin Project.

## The Odin Project
I completed this as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) as I work to learn JavaScript and improve on my prior web experience with HTML, CSS, and only borrowed scripts!
